in first lab i make a dynamic calculator which can sole equations with parantheses

in second task i make a amazing fizz buzz game and a samll analysis


in third task i make a multi reflex agent 
Scenario: Smart Home Temperature Control
Description:
Imagine a smart home with multiple rooms. Each room has a thermostat that controls the heating system. The goal is to maintain a comfortable temperature in each room (e.g., 22°C). The smart home system is equipped with a Simple Reflex Agent that can:
•	Sense the current temperature of each room.
•	Turn the heater on if the temperature is below 22°C.
•	Turn the heater off if the temperature is 22°C or above.
We will also explore a Model-Based Reflex Agent that remembers whether the heater was on or off in the previous cycle to avoid redundant actions.
 
Simple Reflex Agent Example:
This agent will check the current temperature and decide whether to turn the heater on or off.
